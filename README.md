# Bayesian Deep Learning reading group

Schedule for the BDL reading group. Feel free to pick one of the cool short papers at these recent workshops. Or if you would like to present another paper which interests you and is along the same thread as the workshops below that is also great. Add the yourself and the paper in the table below.

There might be a cool BDL paper being presented at the BXL rg, I will let you know. Email Saad who runs the BXL reading group to gain access.

## Potential papers

* [ICML Uncertainty and Robustness workshop 2020](https://sites.google.com/view/udlworkshop2020/accepted-papers)
* [Neurips Bayesian Deep Learning workshop 2019](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org/)
